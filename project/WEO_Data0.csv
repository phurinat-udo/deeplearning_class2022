Fiscal assumptions: Revenue projection is driven by nominal GDP with the elasticity higher than 1 due to ""recovery"" from the crisises (Hurrican Dorian and Covid-19 pandemic). Expenditure projection is based on the budget and additional expenditure measures. The FY2019/20 fiscal outturn is IMF staff's estimate based on the authorities' published data. Because of classification differences, total expenditure and the overall deficit for FY2019/20 are smaller than the authorities' estimates. Reporting in calendar year: No. Original source is in fiscal year for fiscal series. Debt series are provided in quarterly frequency.

Subnational data are incorporated with a lag of up to one year; general government data are thus finalized well after central government data. IMF and Indian presentations differ, particularly regarding disinvestment and license-auction proceeds, net versus gross recording of revenues in certain minor categories, and some public sector lending. Starting in FY2020/21 expenditure also includes the off-budget component of food subsidies consistent with the revised treatment of food subsidies in the budget. Staff adjust expenditure to take out payments for previous years' food subsidies, which are included as expenditure in budget estimates for FY2020/21.

Data takes into account statistical revisions (including on student loans accounting) implemented on September 24, 2019, and revisions to historical data released on December 22, 2020. Latest actual data: 2021 Notes: Note the general government variables exclude the temporary effects of financial interventions. Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the latest GDP data published by the Office of National Statistics on August 12, 2022, and forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility from March 23, 2022. Revenue projections are adjusted for differences between the IMF staff's forecasts of macroeconomic variables (such as GDP growth and inflation) and the forecasts of these variables assumed in the authorities' fiscal projections. Projections assume that there is some additional fiscal consolidation relative to the policies announced to date starting in FY2023/24 with the goal of complying with the new fiscal rules announced at the time of the Spending Review on October 27, 2021, and to secure public debt sustainability.  The IMF staff's data exclude public sector banks and the effect of transferring assets from the Royal Mail Pension Plan to the public sector in April 2012. Real government consumption and investment are part of the real GDP path, which, according to the IMF staff, may or may not be the same as projected by the UK Office for Budget Responsibility.

These funds are recorded as revenues, consistent with IMF's methodology. Therefore, data and projections for 2018 - 2021 are affected by these transfers, which amounted to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2018, 1.1 percent of GDP in 2019, 0.6 percent of GDP in 2020, and are projected to be 0.3 percent of GDP in 2021 and zero percent thereafter. Please see IMF country report No. 19/64 for further details. The disclaimer about the public pension system applies only for the revenues and net lending/borrowing series.

The coverage of the fiscal data was changed from consolidated public sector to nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) with the October 2019 submission. In Uruguay, NFPS coverage includes Central Government, Local Government, Social Security Funds, Nonfinancial Public Corporations, and Banco de Seguros del Estado. Historical data was revised accordingly. Under this narrower fiscal perimeter assets and liabilities held by the NFPS where the counterpart is the central bank are not netted out in debt figures. In this context, capitalization bonds issued in the past by the government to the central bank are now part of the NFPS debt. Gross and net debt estimates for the period 2008-2011 are preliminary.
